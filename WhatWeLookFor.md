# What we look for

## How is source code setup?

  - is there an SCMS? Which one?
  - how do the commit messages look?

## In source code:

  - how is the JSON documented?
  - are there tests?
  - what were the decisions on the datastore and why?

## Response structure:

  - is response in JSON or something else?
  - is the timestamp included in the actual response?
  - is the response to all the currencies vs. single currency consistent?
  - are all the responses consistently designed?
